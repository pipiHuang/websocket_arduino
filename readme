This is node.js + arduino + websocket technique code.
will use websocket api, serial api, http module and so on.
reference others and write by myself!
function: 
1.client(html) send on/off signal to board to control LED light
2.board send 'hello world' to client(html), and html display 'hello world'

NOTE: experiment in NAT environment

solved problem:
NAT port forwarding
CORS (different domain cannot access)
